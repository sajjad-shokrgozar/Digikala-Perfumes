# PerfumeWebcrawling
This web-scraper extracts all perfume from digikala store.
How use it?
In the first step, the link of all perfumes must be extracted from digikala. GetProductsLink does this.
When you run GetProductsLink.py, a .txt (can be a CSV file) will be created next to these files. Then, by executing the getProductData.py file, all the data of each perfume will be extracted. This takes about 2 hours and downloads about 1Â GB.
